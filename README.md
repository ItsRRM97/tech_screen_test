# tech_screen_test
This is my screening exam for internship at greendoorglobal.com

TECH Screen Test (Timeframe - 3 Days to complete):
 
Create a basic web application with following features :
 
1. Registration page for Buyer
2. Registration page for Seller
3. Page to show list of sellers/buyers
4. Page to create/show list of services offered [Optional]
 
Use AngularJs as the front end framework.

There is a lot of features that can be added to this simple registration page. But due to shortage of time and my college classes I couldn't fix some of the errors. This is a template I copied from the internet and made certain changes to it so that it fits the task. If you want to see the original template, please visit the following post http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2015/03/10/angularjs-user-registration-and-login-example-tutorial

I learnt the basics of AngularJS by my self in the given time frame and build whatever I could have built. I hope it satisfies you considering the above reasons I have mentioned.
